    title: "We Need a Database! Digitization Practices in Contemporary Art Ventures and Emergent Trends",
    abstract: "ABSTRACT: What do an art dealer, a private collection, an artist studio or an estate have in common in the contemporary art sector? Usually –besides the same names of high calibre personalities in the address book– they all believe they need a database: and they need it now! They don't know exactly what they want it for and what kind of database they really need, but for sure it must be both tailor made and as good as their friend's or competitor's one. Indeed, in the last decade there was a true “database run” in the field of small and medium sized art ventures to better organise their internal workflow and to keep up with big museums. Diego Mantoan builds upon his direct expertise in planning and delivering digitisation projects for contemporary art institutes, in order to focus on theoretical issues and practical problems that arise when developing digital art archives in a sector that needs databases not just for research purposes, but rather to tackle managerial tasks as well as to enhance one’s art historical position and to strengthen market reputation.",

    title: "The Bestseller Code: Predicaments of Predicting High Value Fiction",
    abstract: "ABSTRACT: Publishing literature is a precarious business these days. Ever greater numbers of books are being published, but revenue for literary production is falling consistently over the years. Increasingly literary publishers rely on a few bestsellers to 'win big' so publishing literature remains a viable business. Therefore it is not just interesting from a literary studies point of view to know what text immanent properties are characteristic for bestsellers. This knowledge may even prove vital for literary production to survive. At the Huygens Institute in Amsterdam a research group in the literary studies department is taking a computational approach to this problem. Their research applies advanced computational statistics and machine learning techniques to pinpoint textual markers that can be associated with successful fiction writing. In this lecture their methods are explained and results are critically evaluated.",

    title: "Infrastructure, Skills, Voice: Digital Participation Beyond Access in Post-Industrial Heritage",
    abstract: "Digital communication is often conceived of as democratising heritage. Sharing information about hard to reach locations, or making more detailed information available than is possible on tradition information boards. Even this seminar series shows the power of digital heritage to cross borders. But it also creates new borders.  In post industrial cities, access to infrastructure and digital literacy can reinforce the exclusion that people may experience from their own pasts. The pandemic has made these issues all the more pressing. This paper will look at these issues in Swansea South Wales to consider the interaction between digital methods and participation.",

    title: "What is ‘Digital Latin’? An Overview of the Digital Latin Library",
    abstract: "ABSTRACT: This presentation will begin with a deliberate misreading of the names of the Digital Latin Library and its Library of Digital Latin Texts. Although 'digital' is meant to modify 'library' and 'texts', respectively, it could just as easily apply to 'Latin', which prompts our question: 'What is digital Latin?' In truth, the DLL hews closely to the methods and practices of traditional textual criticism, and it does not seek to replace traditional printed editions with digital ones. Instead, it aims to promote a different perspective on texts themselves, not only as printed objects, but also as databases of information that can be stored, queried, visualized, and read in a variety of ways. Accordingly, this presentation will interrogate the idea of 'digital Latin' through a survey of the DLL's current and ongoing projects, with a view to highlighting the DLL's efforts to connect Latin's analog past with its digital future.",

    title: "1516: A Visually Searchable Database of Early-Printed Illustration from the 15th and 16th centuries",
    abstract: "ABSTRACT: 1516 is an online database of illustrations printed in the 15th and 16th century. This database can be searched using an image as a search query  as well as using text keyword for searching metadata assigned to the  illustrations. Such a visual and text search capability allows research  scholars to track and investigate the production, use, circulation and  copying of woodblocks, iconographic subjects, artistic styles, within  15th and 16th-century printed illustrated editions. The database is  publicly accessible and accepts contributions of new illustrations and  metadata from research scholars from all over the world. The 1516  project is an evolutionary next step of the existing 15cILLUSTRATION  database, which is based solely on illustrations printed in the 15th  century. The possibility of searching together images printed in the  15th and in the 16th century represents a natural and novel step  forward, as woodblocks and iconographic themes travelled well beyond  chronological boundaries. The 1516 database is being developed by Dr  Abhishek Dutta, Dr Matilde Malaspina and Dr Barbara Tramelli under the  guidance of Prof. Andrew Zisserman and Prof. Cristina Dondi. ",

    abstract: "ABSTRACT: Motivated by the need to create an open access publishing platform dedicated to comics scholarship that embraced the values of frictionless sharing and online public engagement, The Comics Grid was initially conceived and developed in 2009 by a group of comics scholars interested in digital scholarship. It launched in 2010 as an “open access, collaborative peer-reviewed comics studies blog”. Since 2013 The Comics Grid: Journal of Comics Scholarship has been a fully-fledged open access, peer-reviewed journal. In this presentation I will present qualitative and quantitative insights from a decade as editor-in-chief of the journal, discussing the challenges overcome so far and the journal’s vision for the type of comics scholarship the editors would like to see in future volumes of the journal. The intention is to also discuss the journal's online dissemination and engagement strategy, offering some insights from an analysis of our social media, journal metrics and other online indicators.",

    title: "Cultural Heritage, Participation and Platforms: Theoretical and Methodological Challenges",
    abstract: "ABSTRACT: In the last few years, participatory platforms have become particularly popular in the field of cultural heritage. Research generally identifies two types of platforms. On the one hand, institutional platforms, that usually take the form of crowdsourcing platforms, are created by libraries, archives, museums, etc. in order to engage the public in specific tasks related to their collections such as transcription or annotation of documents. On the other hand, informal groups of amateurs can use the web (social media or other Web 2.0 solutions) to create their own collections of cultural objects. Such participatory collections constitute interesting combinations of cultural heritage and born-digital heritage. This communication will focus on the theoretical and methodological challenges raised by the study of this phenomenon. First, it will propose a theoretical perspective to interpreting this phenomenon of participatory platforms through the history of the amateur. Second, it will present a methodological framework for analysing participatory platforms.",

    title: "Advanced Imaging to Support the Digital Humanities",
    abstract: "ABSTRACT: In parallel with the development of Digital Humanities as a discipline, imaging technologies have advanced to provide new insights into cultural heritage objects. Over the past 2 decades, digital multispectral imaging has emerged as a useful tool to reveal more information about objects. Portable commercial multispectral imaging systems are now available for use in libraries, universities and other institutions.  Imaging with higher energy levels such as x-ray fluorescence also provides additional elemental information for some objects. To support Digital Humanities research, all these imaging methods require integration of new technologies, work processes and training.  With these and standardized metadata, digital humanities practitioners can efficiently manage the large amounts of image data and share them with open access. This seminar will cite recent imaging projects that highlight the development of advanced imaging and data management.  This will include discussions of current technologies and online resources available to support research.",

    abstract: "The award winning Hidden Florence app (published in 2014 - with major updates in 2019 - free for iOS and Android) offers users an unconventional tour of Renaissance Florence, using historical guide characters, GPS and Stefano Buonsignori’s beautiful woodcut map of the city. The HERA-funded Hidden Cities project recently launched 5 new city apps that develop the same format, extending it through connecting with museum objects documenting the material culture of public space. This talk presents a number of illustrated vignettes of street life in the Renaissance city that inform the app’s many stories; from pub brawls to football games, charitable gift-giving to elite patronage. In so doing it shows how new technologies and digital approaches can shed light on material traces of the past still visible - but often overlooked - in the present day city fabric, offering clues to how people lived in the past.",

    abstract: "Museums perform object-based research. Some, such as the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam,  generate complex data on their objects due to the impact of scientific analytical as well as imaging methods, sometimes with spectacular, beautiful results. However, such data need interpretation to become meaningful: they need story telling about the object’s making, owners, travels, survival through time and so on. This is not only key for the interpretation of such data, but also crucial for dissemination of all this new knowledge to the public. The object’s biography needs framing. Can we create digital contexts that allow interoperability of data, and indeed allow story telling?",

    title: "Principles of Cyberarchaeology",
    abstract: "ABSTRACT: Cyber-Archaeology is a branch of archaeological research concerned with the digital simulation and investigation of the potential past. The term recalls the ecological cybernetics approach based on the informative modeling of the organism-environment relationships. More specifically, it aims to investigate the past through the interaction with multimodal simulation models of archaeological datasets in different areas of knowledge. The cognitive-interpretive process is accomplished through an interaction-feedback loop in a virtual reality environment, following a non-linear learning path. This process allows for the formation and validation of scientific theories about archaeological contexts and material cultures. Cyberarchaeology has actually revolutionized modern archaeology throughout the use of massive digital recording, virtual simulation, data curation and digital transmission. This work can be seen at the intersection between empiricism and simulation. Empiricism by developing tools for data capture and autoptic evaluation in the field, simulation in relation to data processing and modeling in labs and virtual environments. Along with the functionality of VR to enable unique ways to integrate spatial maps and VR renderings through a series of virtual models, a second functionality deals with the ability to find relationality between many different digital media artifacts. Here contemporary search mechanisms and annotation methods enable new forms of interactive juxtaposition of diverse media elements in virtual domains. Therefore. interpretation in cyberarchaeology is characterized by multivocality, collaborative work, networking, new digital media and open digital narratives; it is a fluid and open process. What shall archaeologists do with these kind and amount of data? How can we deal with this hyper-accuracy? What beyond a 3D model? How can we codify and transmit this knowledge to the future?",

    abstract: "ABSTRACT: Criteria for evaluating projects are well established in traditional humanities research, whereas there are currently only tentative efforts to develop evaluative frameworks in the field of digital humanities for digital projects and outputs, and there is not yet consensus on these. I will reflect on methods and standards for the  work with 'data' in humanities and in digital scholarly projects. My talk will first address issues related to the data ecosystem in a DH project (which involves data organisation, modelling, documentation, visualisation, archiving, and sustainability). I will then discuss the professional skills that a DH researcher is often required to have across the spectrum of both DH and traditional humanities. This can be related to the so-called data curation process used to model a domain-specific knowledge, so as to create and share complex digital objects thereby increasing accessibility and sustainability. A digital scholarly project requires a hermeneutical approach involving a deep analysis of the object of study as well as skills of data management, modelling and curation that support long-term preservation, access and reuse of data. These aspects should also serve to assess-aspects of openness (open source and open access) and to pursue inclusivity and reach a wider audience.",
